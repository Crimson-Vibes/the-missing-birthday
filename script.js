Anyways, I’m not great at serious letters, so if this gets a bit weird, that’s just me trying my best.

This whole thing we’ve been doing, the chaos, the choices, the frogs showing up where they absolutely shouldn’t, yeah… that wasn’t all accidental. Some of it was, yes. A concerning amount, actually. But it became something anyway.

I thought I was just building something fun. And it was. But somewhere between all the nonsense, it turned into something else too. Not big. Not dramatic. Just something that exists now because you went through it.

And I don’t think I planned for that part. That you’d actually be here. Reading this. Not skipping it. Just here.

So I’ll say it properly, once.

I’m glad you made it this far. That’s it. Just that.

I think you know it too.

So whether today was amazing...
Or messy... Or ordinary...
Or somewhere in between...

I hope you found at least one thing that made you smile.
One tiny reminder that even on the busiest days, you deserve moments of happiness too.

So here's your final achievement:
🏆 Birthday Successfully Recovered
Congratulations.

You did it,
You completed the adventure.
The carpet can finally retire.
The frogs can return to their mysterious frog business.
And Bun Bun can finally take a nap.

So whether you celebrated a lot, a little, or accidentally got dragged into a magical carpet adventure...
I hope today reminded you that you're appreciated more than you know.
Happy Birthday, Shreya.
Thank you for coming on this very serious, extremely professional, and definitely not ridiculous adventure.
Now go enjoy the rest of your day.
Go eat some cake.
Or at least think about cake.

Ribbit.
We have arrived.
Ribbit ribbit.

We are watching your journey from a respectful distance.
(One frog is too close. Please ignore him.)

The Frog Council has been observing you.
Quietly.
From various locations.
Mostly ponds.

After careful consideration...

The council has reached a decision.

We are proud.
Not because everything made sense.
But because you did it anyway.

Ribbit ribbit.

This is important frog philosophy.
We learned it yesterday.

You are officially Frog Approved.

IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENTS:
- Do not trust shiny objects.
- Do not trust frogs who say “trust me”.
- Do not trust Bunbun when he says “this is normal”.
He is lying.
Ribbit.

FINAL NOTE:
If confusion increases, remain calm.
Frogs are handling it.
(We are not handling it.)

Ribbit ribbit ribbit.
