I know you didn’t think this would turn into anything like this.

But then you pressed the red button.
And because of that… the carpet has finally landed. 
So I guess… this is where it ends.

And honestly…

I think that’s okay.

Somewhere along the way, things stopped being just buttons and choices.

The carpet showed up like it had something to say.

The investigation kept insisting on answers nobody asked for.

The gift boxes appeared even when they weren’t invited.

And the frogs… well, they were just there. As always.

Somehow, all of it happened anyway.

But before we go, there's just one last thing.

Birthdays can feel strange sometimes.

Some years they're loud and exciting. Some years they're quiet.

Some years arrive while you're busy thinking about a hundred other things.

Not because it has to be perfect.

Not because every birthday needs balloons, cake, and a grand celebration.

The people who care about you know it.

The people who remembered today know it.

The person who made this website definitely knows it.

And after spending this entire adventure with you...

I think Bun Bun knows it too.

So whether today was amazing...

Or messy...

Or ordinary...

Or somewhere in between...

I hope you found at least one thing that made you smile.

One thing that made the day feel a little lighter.

One tiny reminder that even on the busiest days, you deserve moments of happiness too.

So here's your final achievement:

🏆 Birthday Successfully Recovered

Congratulations.

You did it.

You completed the adventure.

The carpet can finally retire.

The frogs can return to their mysterious frog business.

And Bun Bun can finally take a nap.

So whether you celebrated a lot, a little, or accidentally got dragged into a magical carpet adventure...

I hope today reminded you that you're appreciated more than you know.

Happy Birthday, Shreya.

Thank you for coming on this very serious, extremely professional, and definitely not ridiculous adventure.

Now go enjoy the rest of your day.

Go eat some cake.

Or at least think about cake.

Ribbit.

We have arrived.

Ribbit ribbit.

We are watching your journey from a respectful distance.

---

Summary of observations:

• You walked. Ribbit.  
• You paused for dramatic effect. Ribbit ribbit.  
• You made questionable decisions (we support this).  
• One frog tried to press a button. We stopped him. Barely.  
• Another frog is currently eating the report.  

Ribbit.

---

We are proud.
Not because everything made sense.
But because you did it anyway.
Ribbit ribbit.
This is important frog philosophy.
We learned it yesterday.

---

IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENTS:

Do not trust shiny objects.
Do not trust frogs who say “trust me”.
Do not trust Bunbun when he says “this is normal”.
He is lying.
Ribbit.

FINAL NOTE:

If confusion increases, remain calm.
Frogs are handling it.
(We are not handling it.)
Ribbit ribbit ribbit.
